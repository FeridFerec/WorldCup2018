                                him. “This looks like a funeral parlour, and tomorrow the World Cup begins,” he said,
                                grinning. Alongside him Fernando Hierro, Spain’s new manager, grinned too.
                                Together they got up and walked through the door, down the tunnel and out on to the

                    <h4>Interview</h4>
                    <h2>Uruguay’s Diego Godín: ‘They kicked Luis Suárez out like a dog. It was unjust, disproportionate’
                    </h2>
                    <p>By<a href="x">Sid Lowe</a></p>
                    <p>As the Uruguay team boarded their plane bound for the World Cup, elaborate thermos flasks under
                        their arms, the cargo was loaded in the hold: boots, shirts and shorts, plus 180kg of yerba mate
                        and 30kg of dulce de leche. They needed a special permit to take them into Russia, but they were
                        not going to go without their impossibly bitter “tea” or their impossibly sweet caramel. Anyway,
                        why change?
                        There is something about Uruguay, something different, which has served them well. Something in
                        the way they live, the way they play – and, says the captain, Diego Godín, in Uruguay living and
                        playing are the same thing. That’s part of the secret.</p>

                    <p>Uruguay, who kick off their Group A campaign against Egypt on Friday, are football’s great
                        overachievers: they have won two World Cups and 15 Copa Américas, were World Cup semi-finalists
                        in 1970 and 2010, and four years ago knocked out Italy and England. </p>
                    <p>They arrive in Russia with Godín insisting expectations are high: “We’re going there to win, to
                        compete,” he says.</p>
